Cross-compilation to Windows is possible using mingw32 packages. It has been
tested on x86_64 Arch Linux. The cross-compiling build directory needs
native-built data processing tools for generating the data source code. It
expects to find these in a sister directory called `build` where a regular
CMake build has been set up and used to build at least the data generation
tool binaries.
